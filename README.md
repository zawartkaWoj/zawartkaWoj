<h1>SOFTWARE TESTER PORTFOLIO - Wojciech Zawartka</h1>
<br>
<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Wojtek! Few years ago I've retired from being a printing specialist to pursue career in the IT industry.</p>
<p>Testing isn't unfamiliar territory to me â€” I have four years of commercial experience testing computer games, including my own hobby projects which required me to debug a lot of code. I have hands-on experience of collaborating with developers, maintaining continuous communication, and reporting bugs, as well as providing detailed descriptions of issues and offering suggestions for gameplay improvements. I'm very detail-oriented and patient, able to think analytically and understand end-user needs depending on the product being tested.
